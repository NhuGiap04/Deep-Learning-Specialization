I. LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
. multiple words with the same meaning (synonymy)
. one word with multiple meanings (polysemy)

Synonyms:
. "buy" and "purchase"
. "big" and "large"
. "quick" and "speedy"

Polysemes:
"Man", "Milk"

Latent Variables:
z = 0.7 * computer + 0.5 * PC + 0.6 * laptop
Would this help with polysemy?

II. T-SNE + K-MEANS: FINDING CLUSTERS OF RELATED WORDS
K-Means Application: Related Words
. Plot and find clusterings of words from book titles

Create a term-document matrix (each "document" is a book title"
. N = # words in vocabulary
. D = # documents
. X[n, d] = # of times word n appears in document d

. Convert X into a TF-IDF matrix
. Reduce dimensionality from D -> 2, so that we can plot it : "t-SNE"
. Finally, we perform K-means with K = N/10

Highlights:
. Save scatterplot instead of showing it
E.g:
random_colors = np.random.random((K, 3))
colors = R.dot(random_colors)
plt.figure(figsize=(80.0, 80.0))
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], s=300, alpha=0.9, c=colors)
annotate1(X, index_word_map)
plt.savefig("test.png")
