1. PCA for NLP
. Consider synonyms
. 2 words that have the same meaning
E.g: "tiny" / "small",  "teacher" / "instructor"
Why is PCA useful here?
. PCA's job: to reduce dimensionality and decorrelate
. In order to reduce dimensionality, the raw data must contain redundancy
. Redundancy happens in the form of correlations
